A/B testing script for Google Tag Manager
=========================================

_Made by [Simon Vreeman](http://vreeman.com)._

Features & requirements:
- Itâ€™s lean and simple. So just for A/B testing and not (yet) for multi var testing.
- Data is send to the dataLayer. Create a extra tag for sending the data to Google Analytics.
- Create a macro for the random number and name it Random Number.

I stopped maintaining this script, yet it still works fine. Together with @Martijnsch I rebuild [the script for A/B testing at The Next Web](https://github.com/MartijnSch/cro).
